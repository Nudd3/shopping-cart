# Shopping Cart Project

## About
This is a project where I've created an online store using HTML, CSS, and ReactJS. 
It contains three pages, where "Home" and "Contact" can be seen more as fillers that I've included to give the site a more "real-world" feeling. 
At the "Store" page is where the main stuff is happening. 

The project is a part of [The Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com/). More precisely, the Full Stack JavaScript course.
